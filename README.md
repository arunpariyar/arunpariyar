### console.info("üôè Hello World !");

I am a fullstack developer, currently working as a JavaScript Instrutor at CodeWorks.

ü§î I can't decide if i love frontend more than backend but i am always down for writing vanilla CSS.

üíú I love all things code and community.

üèÑ I am currently working on HourOne a learning exchange platfrom with the format of exchanging an hour for an hour

‚ú® I am frequently volunteering for React Berlin Meetup and other tech meetups in Berlin

üå≥ When not coding, I am mostly out in nature.
